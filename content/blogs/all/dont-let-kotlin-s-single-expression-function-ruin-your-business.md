Hello developers ðŸ‘‹, This is a mini-blog where weâ€™ll see how a small mistake can lead to a confusing and serious issue.

Kotlin provides us with a way where we can define single-expression functions for one-shot operations. For e.g. we do something like this ðŸ‘‡

The return type of the above function will be the return type of the result of `findItemById()`, right? In the single-expression function, we donâ€™t have a need to specify return type since itâ€™s automatically inferred by Kotlinâ€™s compiler.

The real problem ðŸ˜¬
-------------------

One day I was playing with Kotlin and while doing it I came across an issue that was actually produced by my own mistake. This issue looks small but it took me some time to came to know about it.

Now letâ€™s understand how can our mistake lead to the issues. So refer to the below code.

WhatðŸ˜•? Just _Good Morning_? Why _Good Afternoon_ isnâ€™t printed?

How? ðŸ¤”
-------

Did you notice `= {}` in `greetGoodAfternoon()` function? So this where the problem comes from. Letâ€™s understand the issue.

So any developer wonâ€™t be intentionally writing such code. It may be just like we introduce typo mistakes! As we know, in a single-expression function, the returning type of a function is automatically inferred by the compiler (if not specified explicitly). When we write `= {}`, its return type is inferred internally as this ðŸ‘‡

Yes, itâ€™s inferred as a lambda block ðŸ˜…. So when we called `greetGoodAfternoon()` it returned a lambda! If we call `greetGoodAfternoon().invoke()` or `greetGoodAfternoon()()` then itâ€™ll be get executed (_Because you now know what happened_ ðŸ˜„).

> **Note:** IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio warns you if you do such mistakes. But even after that if you ignored it, no one can help you.

Solution ðŸ’¡
-----------

We are humans!ðŸ˜¯ We always will do mistakes but thatâ€™s fine. The mistake which we did above (`= {}`) canâ€™t be solved using any manual way. But there are some learnings by which we can avoid other related issues.

In my opinion, good practice to avoid mistakes will be a **_habit of mentioning return types explicitly!_** Yes, if we mention it explicitly _(even if using a simple-expression function)_ then itâ€™ll avoid mistakes then weâ€™ll be sure about such things at compile time itself.

By this, we can be sure that this function is returning `Item`. If not, then the compiler will be there to help you out. It makes code more readable and also we can be sure about it just by reading it (_like what exactly function is returning_). It can help the reviewer while reviewing code on GitHub as well ðŸ˜Ž.

For a simple, one-liner call that _doesnâ€™t return anything_, then this is fine ðŸ‘‡

Thereâ€™s no doubt that Kotlin has made developerâ€™s life simple and easy. But anyone can do such mistakes.

So the final conclusion is ðŸ‘‡

> Mention return type of a **function** explicitly and make it a habit!

If you liked this article then share it with everyone! Maybe itâ€™ll help someone who needs it.

Thank you ðŸ˜ƒ
