We all know that Sprints are essential to agile software development since they help teams break down large projects into manageable chunks.

&nbsp;

Each sprint has a fixed duration, usually between 1— 4 weeks ⏳, and at the end of each sprint, the team holds a review to assess their progress and plan the next sprint.

&nbsp;

But before planning the next sprint it’s crucial to know if your previous sprint has failed or succeeded.

* Did the team meet the sprint goal?
* Did the team deliver the expected value?
* Was the sprint completed on time?
* Were there any major issues or obstacles during the sprint?
* Was the team able to collaborate effectively?
* Did the team receive feedback from stakeholders?

There could be many reasons why a sprint failed, but one of the most common reasons I have seen is 💡…

> **_Lack of understanding of the actual development time available in a particular sprint, by the Project Managers and by the Stakeholders.._**

What do I mean by that? 🤔

&nbsp;

Let me try to explain to you with an example.

&nbsp;

Assuming your software development team is following a 2 weeks sprint ⏳…

&nbsp;

Ideally, your team should have a development time of **80 hours ⏰ per sprint,** considering 10 working days and 8 working hours each day.

&nbsp;

With this assumption, most of the Project Managers or the Stakeholders pick up stories/tasks worth 80 hours of development (per sprint) and assign them to the development team, expecting them to finish their work by the end of the sprint. ❌

&nbsp;

So what’s wrong here? 🤦‍♂️

> **_Project Managers and Stakeholders usually forget about the time taken for additional Agile Ceremonies which occurs during the sprint._**

What are these additional agile ceremonies and how much of your development time does it take?

* **Daily Standup — 15 mins** (_does it ever finish on time?_ 😞)
* **Story Kick-Off — 15 mins** (_sometimes needed for clarifying user stories_ 🚀)
* **Sprint Grooming — 45 mins** (_review and refine the Product Backlog items, prioritize and estimate them_ 📝)
* **Sprint Planning — 45 mins** (_select the highest-priority items from the backlog, break them down into actionable tasks, and determine how much work the team can realistically complete during the sprint_ 📆)
* **Retrospective — 30 mins** (_if done after every sprint then 30 mins is enough_ 😮‍💨)
* **Internal Demo — 45mins** (_most team members always spend time on internal demo, before giving a final demo to the stakeholders/clients_ 💁)
* **Sprint Demo — 60mins** (_demo with stakeholders/clients_🤵‍♀️)
* **Brainstorming Session — 45 mins** (_if any team member is stuck with complex flows or edge cases or needs some help_ 🧠)
* **Communication — 30mins** (_ad-hoc chat/calls/meetings with team members or stakeholders on the official communication channel_ 💬)
* **DevBox Testing — 15 mins** (_done by developer and QA on developer’s local machine for early identification and resolution of bugs and issues_ 🐞)

Based on the above-mentioned agile ceremonies and their respective time, and also considering some of the above ceremonies don’t have to be performed on all the 10 days of the 2-week sprint, here is a **rough calculation:**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*ZKnsrHP1jYYz0Fyz4xmq6A.png)

As per the above calculation, a developer spends around **15 hours on agile ceremonies out of 80 hours of development.**

&nbsp;

Note — Not necessary that every company or project might have these above agile ceremonies, so you can consider the above timings based on the processes you follow.

&nbsp;

Assuming most of the developers can’t be 100% productive during those 8 hours of working (maybe because of various distractions, calls, meetings, etc) plus they might need a few hours for bug fixes, etc, **I think it’s safe to say that we can have only around 60 hours of productive development time in a 2 weeks sprint.**

&nbsp;

**So let’s ensure you set your next sprint expectations right to help your agile teams stay focused and deliver high-quality work quickly.**

&nbsp;

Some of the other commonly known reasons for a sprint failure 🤷‍♂️:

* **Poorly defined user stories** can lead to confusion, assumptions, and incomplete features.
* **Poor communication** within the team or with stakeholders can lead to misunderstandings and a lack of progress.
* **Insufficient planning** can result in inaccurate estimates and missed deadlines.
* **Scope not clearly defined and managed** can expand the timeline beyond what was originally intended.
* **Poor team dynamics** can lead to a negative work environment and decreased trust among team members.
* **Lack of stakeholder engagement or providing timely feedback** can lead to poor collaboration, unrealistic expectations, and disappointment.
* **Inadequate testing** can result in defects and quality issues that can derail a sprint.
* **Poor code quality** can increase complexity and decrease the quality of work over time.
* **Technical debt** (the cost of maintaining and fixing existing code) can lead to delays, bugs, and a lower-quality product
* **Ineffective use of tools and technology** can hinder productivity, and slow down development.
* **Lack of flexibility and inability to adapt to changing requirements** can prevent team members from embracing Agile methodologies and the sprint process.
* **Poor leadership** from the scrum master or product owner can cause misalignment, decreased productivity, and a lack of focus.
* **Excessive, Insufficient, Outdated, and Unclear documentation** can create unnecessary complexity, and confusion, and impede progress.
* **Poor time management** can result in missed deadlines and rushed work.
* **An overloaded sprint backlog** can cause team members to become overwhelmed and unable to complete their tasks effectively.
* **Insufficient resources** such as hardware, software, or personnel, can lead to delays and burnout.
* **Frequent change requirements** added during the sprint can cause spillover and incomplete work.
* **Inadequate user research** can lead to building the wrong features and poor user experience.
* **Insufficient attention to process improvement** can lead to significant rework and additional development time and cost.
